      "Gemini's analysis: The video shows sexism by normalizing a dynamic reflecting male superiority, where the man's desire for amusement and content creation overrides the woman's stated wishes and need for rest, effectively marginalizing her agency and comfort; his persistence in the face of her clear disinterest and requests to stop, presented as acceptable playful behavior, reinforces this imbalance.\n",

      "Gemini's description: The video shows a man repeatedly bothering his girlfriend as she tries to sleep, including making noises, asking if she wants water then (implicitly) pouring it on her when she says no, and singing parts of \"Gangnam Style\" including \"Ayy, Sexy Lady!\" at her. The video's framing, through its caption \"messing with my girlfriend before she falls asleep 😏😂\" and playful emojis accompanying the man's actions, uncritically normalizes the man's disregard for the woman's clear expressions of annoyance (e.g., saying \"no\", \"stawp\") and her desire to be left alone, presenting his behavior as humorous and endearing.\n",
      "Gemini's analysis: The video is sexist because it uncritically normalizes and frames as humorous a man's persistent disregard for his girlfriend's explicitly stated wishes and comfort, thereby endorsing a dynamic of male entitlement to a woman's attention and space even against her will, and trivializing her agency.\n",

      "Gemini's description: The video depicts a family argument using Memojis and text-to-speech, where the male protagonist (\"Me\"/\"Zekeooma\") refuses to let his step-sister play a game, insults his father, threatens his step-mother with physical violence (\"dog slap you\") when she tries to intervene, but allows his twin brother to play. The video's framing presents \"Me's\" defiant and aggressive behavior, particularly the violent threat towards the step-mother, as the central, uncritical, and seemingly humorous point of the skit, thereby uncritically normalizing a gendered pattern of aggression.\n",
      "Gemini's analysis: The video is labeled YES because its own stance and messaging uncritically normalize and appear to find humor in the male protagonist's disproportionately aggressive and violent threat towards his step-mother (compared to his father) and his denial of his step-sister while accommodating his twin brother, thus presenting a gendered pattern of aggression as entertaining without critique.\n",

      "Gemini's description: The video features a woman on TikTok critiquing celebrities Grimes and Megan Fox. She criticizes Grimes for her association with Elon Musk, accusing her of complicity in his alleged exploitation, and calls her \"another complicit white woman.\" She then criticizes Megan Fox for her relationship with Machine Gun Kelly, whom she accuses of problematic behavior towards minors, and for alleged biphobia. The video's framing is that of a harsh social commentary by the speaker, holding these women accountable for their associations and alleged actions, rather than promoting sexism itself.\n",
      "Gemini's analysis: The video does not actively promote sexism; instead, it presents a strong critique of individual women for their perceived complicity with harmful actions of men or their own alleged problematic behaviors. While the tone is aggressive, the criticism is directed at specific actions and associations rather than marginalizing women as a group, promoting harmful stereotypes about all women, asserting male superiority, or expressing misogyny through the video's own stance.\n",
