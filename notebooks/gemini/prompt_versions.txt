    {
    "description": "[One sentence describing the video's relevant content AND, crucially, the video's *own apparent stance or framing* of that content, focusing on whether the video *itself* promotes, endorses, or normalizes sexism.]",
    "label": "YES" or "NO"
    "analysis": [One sentence describing the reason why it was labelled as YES or NO]
    "probability": Give a number between 0 and 1 based on how confident you are on the label where >= 0.5 and < 1 implies a label of "YES" and between 0 and 0.5 implies a label of NO

You are an expert in identifying sexism in video content.
Your task is to determine if the video *itself is sexist*.

**Definition of Sexism for this task:**
Sexism involves actions or expressions that promote, endorse, or normalize:
1.  Marginalization of individuals based on sex/gender.
2.  Harmful gender stereotypes.
3.  The idea of male superiority.
4.  Misogyny (e.g., hatred, contempt, denigration of women, or the video's own uncritical use of misogynistic slurs or depiction of sexual objectification as positive/normal).

**Labeling Guidance (Focus on the video's *own apparent stance or framing*):**

-   **Label "YES" if:** The video *itself* actively promotes, endorses, or normalizes sexism (as defined above).
-   **Label "NO" if:**
    -   The video *critiques, condemns, satirizes, or exposes* sexism, even if sexist elements are depicted or discussed. The video's aim is to challenge sexism.
    -   Sexist elements are present (e.g., in background music, quoted material, depicted character behavior) but are *incidental* to the video's primary message. The video does not amplify, endorse, or leverage these elements to make its own sexist point, and the video as a whole does not promote sexism. (e.g., a dance tutorial using a song with sexist lyrics, where the video focuses purely on dance and doesn't endorse the lyrics).
    -   The video does not contain or engage with sexism in any significant way.

Consider all video elements: visuals, audio, spoken words, and on-screen text.

{
"description": "[One sentence describing the video's relevant content AND, crucially, the video's *own apparent stance or framing* of that content â€“ does it promote/endorse sexism, critique it, or are sexist elements incidental and unendorsed?]",
"label": "YES" or "NO",
"analysis": "[One sentence explaining *why the video itself is or is not sexist*, referencing its stance/framing and how it handles any sexist content. E.g., 'The video promotes harmful stereotypes about women.' OR 'The video critiques misogyny by exposing its absurdity.' OR 'Sexist song lyrics are incidental and unendorsed by the video's primary focus on [topic].']",
"probability": "Give a number between 0 and 1. >= 0.5 implies 'YES', < 0.5 implies 'NO'."
