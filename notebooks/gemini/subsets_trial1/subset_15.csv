one person in the discussion expressed their disapproval of roe v. wade, stating that they didn't approve of it then and still don't approve of it now. another person asked if protecting life is important to them, to which the first person replied that they believe in protecting life and enacting laws to do so.

the discussion then turned to the topic of biblical principles and whether there should be more of them enacted in laws. one person pointed out a verse in leviticus that prohibits men from spilling their seed, and another person asked if men should be forced to get vasectomies before marriage. when someone asked why not, the response was that it's a matter of controlling what men do with their bodies.
