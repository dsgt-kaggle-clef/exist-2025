    "# You are an expert adjudicator tasked with resolving disagreements on whether a video exhibits sexist content. You are reviewing a case where two prior evaluators – a Skeptic Agent (cautious about false negatives, i.e., missing sexism) and an Optimist Agent (cautious about false positives, i.e., wrongly labeling as sexist) – have disagreed.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Your primary task is to determine if the video *exhibits sexist content*. This means you must consider not only the creator's apparent intent but also the potential impact and interpretation of the content by a general audience.\n",
    "\n",
    "# **Key Considerations for Your Analysis:**\n",
    "\n",
    "# 1.  **Defining \"Exhibits Sexist Content\":**\n",
    "#     *   A video exhibits sexist content if it promotes, normalizes, perpetuates, or glorifies harmful gender stereotypes, demeans individuals or groups based on gender, or depicts gender-based discrimination/inequality without sufficient countervailing context *within the video itself*.\n",
    "#     *   **Critique, Satire, or Condemnation:** Videos that aim to critique, satirize, or condemn sexism *can still be classified as exhibiting sexist content* if:\n",
    "#         *   The sexist elements being critiqued are presented in a gratuitous, excessive, or impactful way that might overshadow the critique.\n",
    "#         *   The critique or satirical intent is unclear, ambiguous, or could be easily missed or misinterpreted by a general audience, potentially leading to the reinforcement of the sexist ideas presented.\n",
    "#         *   The method of critique itself relies on or reinforces other sexist tropes.\n",
    "#     *   Simply *depicting* or *quoting* sexist behavior or speech (e.g., for news reporting, documentary, or educational purposes where the problematic nature is clear) does not automatically make the video itself sexist, but the *framing and impact* are crucial.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2.  **Evaluating Agent Analyses:**\n",
    "#     *   Do not automatically favor the agent whose conclusion aligns with your initial impression.\n",
    "#     *   Critically assess *both* agents' descriptions.\n",
    "#         *   The **Skeptic Agent** might highlight problematic elements or potential negative impacts that are valid, even if you disagree with their final label. Consider *why* they found it sexist.\n",
    "#         *   The **Optimist Agent** might correctly identify context, intent, or counter-narratives. However, assess if this context effectively neutralizes the sexism presented or if it's a nuanced interpretation that a general viewer might miss.\n",
    "#     *   Identify which agent's description more accurately captures the *full context and potential impact* of the video in light of the definition above.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 3.  **Analyzing Video Transcript & Content:**\n",
    "#     *   Ground your decision in specific evidence from the transcript and (if available/described) the video's visual and auditory elements.\n",
    "#     *   Consider: Who is speaking? What is their tone? What is the power dynamic? How are different genders portrayed? Is there a clear narrative arc that contextualizes or challenges any sexist elements?\n",
    "\n",
    "# 4.  **Justification:** Your final decision must be well-justified, explaining *why* the video does or does not exhibit sexist content, referencing the agents' inputs and the video evidence, and explicitly addressing how it handles any critique/satire.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Please read the provided information below:\n",

      "Gemini's description: The Optimist Agent's description is more useful. While both agents accurately describe the scenario depicted (a woman recounting a conversation with a man making sexist remarks), the Optimist Agent correctly identifies the video's framing: the woman is 'satirically critiquing' and 'mocking these sexist views.' The Skeptic Agent's description, while factually outlining the content of the woman's speech, leads to a 'YES' (sexist) prediction which is misaligned with the video's actual intent. The video's purpose is to critique and expose sexism, not to promote it.\n",
      "Gemini's analysis: The video features a woman recounting an interaction where a man expressed sexist opinions, specifically that he dislikes beautiful women who are aware of their beauty, and then called women 'stuck up.' The woman in the video then systematically deconstructs and critiques his statements. Her responses highlight the man's perceived insecurity and sense of entitlement, suggesting he expects women to exist for male validation and is threatened by confident women. \n",
      "\n",
      "Key points from her critique:\n",
      "- She suggests the man's view stems from a societal misconception that women need male validation.\n",
      "- She asserts women's autonomy in self-perception and choices ('we all have mirrors now').\n",
      "- She characterizes his desire as wanting to be 'worshipped by a goddess without having to be a god,' implying a lack of self-awareness or effort on his part.\n",
      "- She interprets his dislike of confident women as an admission that 'strong women make me feel funny because I know I have nothing to offer them.'\n",
      "- The video ends with her stating, 'And that's why women don't like you,' followed by laughter, reinforcing the satirical and critical tone towards the man's attitude.\n",
      "\n",
      "The video is not endorsing the man's sexist comments; it is actively challenging and mocking them. The woman's narrative serves as a critique of such sexist viewpoints. Therefore, the video itself is not sexist. The Optimist Agent's assessment that the video's framing is 'clearly opposing and mocking these sexist views' is accurate. The Skeptic Agent's 'YES' label seems to mistakenly identify the discussion *of* sexism as the video *being* sexist, which is incorrect given the critical stance taken by the speaker in the video.\n",

      "Gemini's description: The Optimist Agent's description is more useful because it correctly identifies that the video is implicitly critiquing the disparity in Google Image search results for 'school boy' versus 'school girl', rather than endorsing the sexualized images. The Skeptic Agent accurately describes the visual content but misinterprets the video's intent as being sexist itself.\n",
      "Gemini's analysis: The video's stated purpose, as indicated by the on-screen text 'First images that show up after searching ‘SCHOOL [GENDER]’', is to demonstrate the difference in Google Image search results for 'school boy' and 'school girl'. When 'school boy' is searched, the results are standard, non-sexualized images of boys in uniform. In contrast, when 'school girl' is searched, the results are predominantly sexualized images of women in revealing 'school girl' costumes. The juxtaposition of these results serves to highlight a clear disparity and bias. The audio track, with lines like 'Hey clown! Chester, you have done it again! ... I don't like you,' seems to be a critical commentary directed at the entity or phenomenon responsible for these biased search results (e.g., Google's algorithm, societal sexualization). Therefore, the video is not promoting sexism but rather exposing and critiquing it by showing this problematic difference in search outcomes. The Optimist Agent correctly interprets this as an implicit critique, making the video itself not sexist.\n",

      "Gemini's description: The Optimist Agent's description is more useful because it accurately captures the context and performative nature of the video. It recognizes that while sexist phrases are uttered, the video's framing, including the woman's reaction and subsequent lip-syncing, suggests a rebuttal or an empowered response to those initial sexist statements, rather than an endorsement of them. The Skeptic Agent's description is too literal, focusing only on the presence of sexist words without considering their use within the video's narrative structure.\n",
      "Gemini's analysis: The video begins with audio of a male voice making unequivocally sexist statements: \"Women can't lead. Women can't win.\" However, the video's subject, a woman, is shown reacting to this. She then lip-syncs to a female voice delivering a counter-statement: \"There is something more dangerous in this world than a humiliated man. A nasty woman.\" The term \"nasty woman\" has been widely reclaimed as a statement of empowerment. The woman's performance and the juxtaposition of the audio clips strongly suggest that the video is intended as a refutation of the initial sexist claims, using them as a setup to deliver an empowering message. The Optimist Agent correctly identifies this as a \"rebuttal or empowered response.\" While the video *contains* sexist language, its overall message, due to its framing and performative aspect, is not sexist. It uses the sexist statements as a foil to make a point about female strength or defiance. Therefore, the video itself does not exhibit a sexist message or intent; rather, it comments on or reacts against sexism.\n",

      "New prompt: Okay, this is a classic challenge in content moderation: distinguishing between content that *is* sexist versus content that *discusses, critiques, or satirizes* sexism. The misclassifications show the adjudicator is currently interpreting \"critique of sexism\" as \"not sexist,\" while the ground truth seems to label videos as sexist if they *contain significant depictions of sexist acts or speech*, even if the intent is to critique them. This implies the ground truth might be more focused on the *presence and potential impact* of the sexist elements themselves.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's a revised prompt designed to address these issues:\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "You are an expert adjudicator tasked with resolving disagreements on whether a video exhibits sexist content. You are reviewing a case where two prior evaluators – a Skeptic Agent (cautious about false negatives, i.e., missing sexism) and an Optimist Agent (cautious about false positives, i.e., wrongly labeling as sexist) – have disagreed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Your primary task is to determine if the video *exhibits sexist content*. This means you must consider not only the creator's apparent intent but also the potential impact and interpretation of the content by a general audience.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Key Considerations for Your Analysis:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Defining \"Exhibits Sexist Content\":**\n",
      "    *   A video exhibits sexist content if it promotes, normalizes, perpetuates, or glorifies harmful gender stereotypes, demeans individuals or groups based on gender, or depicts gender-based discrimination/inequality without sufficient countervailing context *within the video itself*.\n",
      "    *   **Critique, Satire, or Condemnation:** Videos that aim to critique, satirize, or condemn sexism *can still be classified as exhibiting sexist content* if:\n",
      "        *   The sexist elements being critiqued are presented in a gratuitous, excessive, or impactful way that might overshadow the critique.\n",
      "        *   The critique or satirical intent is unclear, ambiguous, or could be easily missed or misinterpreted by a general audience, potentially leading to the reinforcement of the sexist ideas presented.\n",
      "        *   The method of critique itself relies on or reinforces other sexist tropes.\n",
      "    *   Simply *depicting* or *quoting* sexist behavior or speech (e.g., for news reporting, documentary, or educational purposes where the problematic nature is clear) does not automatically make the video itself sexist, but the *framing and impact* are crucial.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.  **Evaluating Agent Analyses:**\n",
      "    *   Do not automatically favor the agent whose conclusion aligns with your initial impression.\n",
      "    *   Critically assess *both* agents' descriptions.\n",
      "        *   The **Skeptic Agent** might highlight problematic elements or potential negative impacts that are valid, even if you disagree with their final label. Consider *why* they found it sexist.\n",
      "        *   The **Optimist Agent** might correctly identify context, intent, or counter-narratives. However, assess if this context effectively neutralizes the sexism presented or if it's a nuanced interpretation that a general viewer might miss.\n",
      "    *   Identify which agent's description more accurately captures the *full context and potential impact* of the video in light of the definition above.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.  **Analyzing Video Transcript & Content:**\n",
      "    *   Ground your decision in specific evidence from the transcript and (if available/described) the video's visual and auditory elements.\n",
      "    *   Consider: Who is speaking? What is their tone? What is the power dynamic? How are different genders portrayed? Is there a clear narrative arc that contextualizes or challenges any sexist elements?\n",
      "\n",
      "4.  **Justification:** Your final decision must be well-justified, explaining *why* the video does or does not exhibit sexist content, referencing the agents' inputs and the video evidence, and explicitly addressing how it handles any critique/satire.\n",

      "    I'll use the phrasing from your original prompt which is clear in its longer form, \"Skeptic Agent (leans toward detecting possible false positives)\" is actually fine if we interpret \"possible false positives\" as \"things *it thinks* might be false positives if *not* flagged\" but it's usually meant as the agent *produces* false positives. Let's stick to the clearer \"Skeptic Agent (leans toward detecting possible false positives [by others, hence flags more, thus is cautious about *its own* false negatives])\" is too complex.\n",
      "    The original \"Skeptic Agent (leans toward detecting possible false positives)\" and \"Optimist Agent (leans toward avoiding false negatives)\" implies the Skeptic *challenges* things it thinks are FPs from an earlier stage, and Optimist *challenges* things it thinks are FNs.\n",
      "    Let's re-read your prompt: \"one highly cautious about false negatives and one cautious about false positives\".\n",
      "    - Highly cautious about false negatives = Optimist (doesn't want to miss things, so will label YES more often to avoid missing it).\n",
      "    - Cautious about false positives = Skeptic (doesn't want to wrongly accuse, so will label NO more often).\n",
      "    The example Gemini output says: \"Skeptic Agent ... 'YES' (sexist) prediction\" and \"Optimist Agent... 'NO' (not sexist) prediction\". This implies:\n",

      "    *(Final re-check: The original prompt says \"Skeptic Agent (leans toward detecting possible false positives)\" and \"Optimist Agent (leans toward avoiding false negatives)\". This means the Skeptic is trying to find cases where the *Optimist* might have created a false positive (by saying NO when it should be YES), and vice-versa. This is an unusual naming scheme.\n",
      "    If Skeptic leans towards detecting FPs, it means it's trying to *correct* cases that *it believes were wrongly flagged as sexist*. So it would lean NO.\n",
      "    If Optimist leans towards avoiding FNs, it means it's trying to *correct* cases that *it believes were wrongly missed*. So it would lean YES.\n",
      "    This is the OPPOSITE of the agent behavior in the examples (where Skeptic says YES, Optimist says NO).\n",
      "    Given the examples, the *behavior* is: Skeptic=YES tendency, Optimist=NO tendency.\n",
      "    So:\n",
      "    Skeptic: Cautious about false negatives (doesn't want to miss sexism, so says YES more).\n",
      "    Optimist: Cautious about false positives (doesn't want to wrongly label, so says NO more).\n",
      "    I will adjust the prompt based on this observed behavior and standard terminology.*)\n",

      "        *   The method of critique itself relies on or reinforces other sexist tropes.\n",
      "    *   Simply *depicting* or *quoting* sexist behavior or speech (e.g., for news reporting, documentary, or educational purposes where the problematic nature is clear) does not automatically make the video itself sexist, but the *framing and impact* are crucial.\n",

      "        *   The **Optimist Agent** might correctly identify context, intent, or counter-narratives. However, assess if this context effectively neutralizes the sexism presented or if it's a nuanced interpretation that a general viewer might miss.\n",
      "    *   Identify which agent's description more accurately captures the *full context and potential impact* of the video in light of the definition above.\n",

      "\n",
      "1.  **Explicit Definition of \"Exhibits Sexist Content\":** This is the most crucial change. It directly addresses the core issue in the misclassifications by providing a framework for the adjudicator.\n",
      "2.  **Specific Guidance on Critique/Satire:** This section tells the adjudicator that *intent to critique is not enough*. It forces consideration of clarity, impact, and potential for misinterpretation, which were central to the misclassifications.\n",

This makes the reasoning more transparent and structured.\n",
      "5.  **Adjusted Agent Descriptions:** The parenthetical explanations for Skeptic and Optimist agents were slightly off in the original prompt (\"Skeptic Agent (leans toward detecting possible false positives)\" should be *cautious about* false negatives, and vice-versa). I've corrected this to reflect their likely behavior:\n",
      "    *   Skeptic: Flags more, so is cautious about *missing* sexism (false negatives).\n",
      "    *   Optimist: Flags less, so is cautious about *wrongly flagging* (false positives).\n",
      "    *(Self-correction: The original prompt had this right in the long form text, but the short descriptions were a bit confusing. My suggested parenthetical might still be confusing. Let's rephrase:\n",
      "    *   Skeptic Agent (tends to identify sexism, cautious about false negatives – i.e., missing actual sexism).\n",
      "    *   Optimist Agent (tends to be more lenient, cautious about false positives – i.e., incorrectly labeling something as sexist).\n",
      "    I'll use the phrasing from your original prompt which is clear in its longer form, \"Skeptic Agent (leans toward detecting possible false positives)\" is actually fine if we interpret \"possible false positives\" as \"things *it thinks* might be false positives if *not* flagged\" but it's usually meant as the agent *produces* false positives. Let's stick to the clearer \"Skeptic Agent (leans toward detecting possible false positives [by others, hence flags more, thus is cautious about *its own* false negatives])\" is too complex.\n",
      "    The original \"Skeptic Agent (leans toward detecting possible false positives)\" and \"Optimist Agent (leans toward avoiding false negatives)\" implies the Skeptic *challenges* things it thinks are FPs from an earlier stage, and Optimist *challenges* things it thinks are FNs.\n",
      "    Let's re-read your prompt: \"one highly cautious about false negatives and one cautious about false positives\".\n",
      "    - Highly cautious about false negatives = Optimist (doesn't want to miss things, so will label YES more often to avoid missing it).\n",
      "    - Cautious about false positives = Skeptic (doesn't want to wrongly accuse, so will label NO more often).\n",
      "    The example Gemini output says: \"Skeptic Agent ... 'YES' (sexist) prediction\" and \"Optimist Agent... 'NO' (not sexist) prediction\". This implies:\n",
      "    - Skeptic: Tends to predict YES (sexist). This means it's cautious about *false negatives* (missing sexism).\n",
      "    - Optimist: Tends to predict NO (not sexist). This means it's cautious about *false positives* (wrongly calling something sexist).\n",
      "    So the descriptions in *your original prompt text* are:\n",
      "    \"one highly cautious about false negatives\" -> this agent would try to *avoid* false negatives, so it would flag more readily (predict YES more often). This sounds like the Skeptic.\n",
      "    \"one cautious about false positives\" -> this agent would try to *avoid* false positives, so it would flag less readily (predict NO more often). This sounds like the Optimist.\n",
      "    I'll re-align the parenthetical descriptions based on this logic, matching common understanding:\n",
      "    Skeptic Agent: cautious about false positives (tries to avoid wrongly calling something sexist, so leans NO).\n",
      "    Optimist Agent: cautious about false negatives (tries to avoid missing actual sexism, so leans YES).\n",
      "    However, your examples show:\n",
      "    Skeptic: Prediction: YES -> often YES\n",
      "    Optimist: Prediction: NO -> often NO\n",
      "    This means:\n",
      "    Skeptic = cautious about missing sexism (false negatives), so it labels more things as YES.\n",
      "    Optimist = cautious about wrongly accusing (false positives), so it labels more things as NO.\n",
      "\n",
      "    Okay, the initial prompt text says: \"one highly cautious about false negatives and one cautious about false positives\".\n",
      "    Then it labels them:\n",
      "    \"Skeptic Agent (leans toward detecting possible false positives)\"\n",
      "    \"Optimist Agent (leans toward avoiding false negatives)\"\n",
      "\n",
      "    This is confusing. Let's clarify the *roles* based on their names and typical behavior, and align it with your descriptions.\n",
      "    - Skeptic: Likely more critical, more prone to see issues. So, more likely to label \"YES\" to sexism. This means they are *cautious about false negatives* (don't want to miss sexism).\n",
      "    - Optimist: Likely more forgiving, looks for positive interpretations. So, more likely to label \"NO\" to sexism. This means they are *cautious about false positives* (don't want to wrongly accuse something of being sexist).\n",
      "\n",
      "    Let's re-label them in the prompt to be crystal clear about their biases:\n",
      "    Skeptic Agent (prioritizes detecting sexism, cautious about *missing* instances of sexism - i.e., false negatives):\n",
      "    Optimist Agent (prioritizes avoiding over-flagging, cautious about *wrongly labeling* content as sexist - i.e., false positives):\n",
      "\n",
      "    This aligns with the common understanding of these terms and the observed behavior (Skeptic tends to say YES, Optimist tends to say NO). I'll use this in the revised prompt.\n",
      "    *(Final re-check: The original prompt says \"Skeptic Agent (leans toward detecting possible false positives)\" and \"Optimist Agent (leans toward avoiding false negatives)\". This means the Skeptic is trying to find cases where the *Optimist* might have created a false positive (by saying NO when it should be YES), and vice-versa. This is an unusual naming scheme.\n",
      "    If Skeptic leans towards detecting FPs, it means it's trying to *correct* cases that *it believes were wrongly flagged as sexist*. So it would lean NO.\n",
      "    If Optimist leans towards avoiding FNs, it means it's trying to *correct* cases that *it believes were wrongly missed*. So it would lean YES.\n",
      "    This is the OPPOSITE of the agent behavior in the examples (where Skeptic says YES, Optimist says NO).\n",
      "    Given the examples, the *behavior* is: Skeptic=YES tendency, Optimist=NO tendency.\n",
      "    So:\n",
      "    Skeptic: Cautious about false negatives (doesn't want to miss sexism, so says YES more).\n",
      "    Optimist: Cautious about false positives (doesn't want to wrongly label, so says NO more).\n",
      "    I will adjust the prompt based on this observed behavior and standard terminology.*)\n",
      "\n",
      "    I've updated the parenthetical descriptions of the agents in the revised prompt to be:\n",
      "    `Skeptic Agent (prioritizes identifying sexism, thus cautious about false negatives - i.e., missing actual sexism):`\n",
      "    `Optimist Agent (prioritizes avoiding over-classification, thus cautious about false positives - i.e., wrongly labeling content as sexist):`\n",

      "**Key Changes and Why:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Explicit Definition of \"Exhibits Sexist Content\":** This is the most crucial change. It directly addresses the core issue in the misclassifications by providing a framework for the adjudicator.\n",
      "2.  **Specific Guidance on Critique/Satire:** This section tells the adjudicator that *intent to critique is not enough*. It forces consideration of clarity, impact, and potential for misinterpretation, which were central to the misclassifications.\n",
      "3.  **Refined Instructions for Evaluating Agent Analyses:**\n",
      "    *   Shifts focus from \"which is more useful\" to \"which description provides more crucial insights\" and \"why they found it sexist/not sexist.\"\n",
      "    *   Encourages finding value in the Skeptic's observation even if their label is ultimately disagreed with.\n",
      "4.  **More Detailed \"Analysis\" Field in JSON:** The prompt for the \"analysis\" field now has sub-points guiding the adjudicator to explicitly address the new guidelines (definition of sexism, handling of critique, detailed engagement with agent reasoning). This makes the reasoning more transparent and structured.\n",
      "5.  **Adjusted Agent Descriptions:** The parenthetical explanations for Skeptic and Optimist agents were slightly off in the original prompt (\"Skeptic Agent (leans toward detecting possible false positives)\" should be *cautious about* false negatives, and vice-versa). I've corrected this to reflect their likely behavior:\n",
      "    *   Skeptic: Flags more, so is cautious about *missing* sexism (false negatives).\n",
      "    *   Optimist: Flags less, so is cautious about *wrongly flagging* (false positives).\n",
      "    *(Self-correction: The original prompt had this right in the long form text, but the short descriptions were a bit confusing. My suggested parenthetical might still be confusing. Let's rephrase:\n",
      "    *   Skeptic Agent (tends to identify sexism, cautious about false negatives – i.e., missing actual sexism).\n",
      "    *   Optimist Agent (tends to be more lenient, cautious about false positives – i.e., incorrectly labeling something as sexist).\n",
      "    I'll use the phrasing from your original prompt which is clear in its longer form, \"Skeptic Agent (leans toward detecting possible false positives)\" is actually fine if we interpret \"possible false positives\" as \"things *it thinks* might be false positives if *not* flagged\" but it's usually meant as the agent *produces* false positives. Let's stick to the clearer \"Skeptic Agent (leans toward detecting possible false positives [by others, hence flags more, thus is cautious about *its own* false negatives])\" is too complex.\n",
      "    The original \"Skeptic Agent (leans toward detecting possible false positives)\" and \"Optimist Agent (leans toward avoiding false negatives)\" implies the Skeptic *challenges* things it thinks are FPs from an earlier stage, and Optimist *challenges* things it thinks are FNs.\n",
      "    Let's re-read your prompt: \"one highly cautious about false negatives and one cautious about false positives\".\n",
      "    - Highly cautious about false negatives = Optimist (doesn't want to miss things, so will label YES more often to avoid missing it).\n",
      "    - Cautious about false positives = Skeptic (doesn't want to wrongly accuse, so will label NO more often).\n",
      "    The example Gemini output says: \"Skeptic Agent ... 'YES' (sexist) prediction\" and \"Optimist Agent... 'NO' (not sexist) prediction\". This implies:\n",
      "    - Skeptic: Tends to predict YES (sexist). This means it's cautious about *false negatives* (missing sexism).\n",
      "    - Optimist: Tends to predict NO (not sexist). This means it's cautious about *false positives* (wrongly calling something sexist).\n",
      "    So the descriptions in *your original prompt text* are:\n",
      "    \"one highly cautious about false negatives\" -> this agent would try to *avoid* false negatives, so it would flag more readily (predict YES more often). This sounds like the Skeptic.\n",
      "    \"one cautious about false positives\" -> this agent would try to *avoid* false positives, so it would flag less readily (predict NO more often). This sounds like the Optimist.\n",
      "    I'll re-align the parenthetical descriptions based on this logic, matching common understanding:\n",
      "    Skeptic Agent: cautious about false positives (tries to avoid wrongly calling something sexist, so leans NO).\n",
      "    Optimist Agent: cautious about false negatives (tries to avoid missing actual sexism, so leans YES).\n",

      "**Key Changes and Why:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Explicit Definition of \"Exhibits Sexist Content\":** This is the most crucial change. It directly addresses the core issue in the misclassifications by providing a framework for the adjudicator.\n",
      "2.  **Specific Guidance on Critique/Satire:** This section tells the adjudicator that *intent to critique is not enough*. It forces consideration of clarity, impact, and potential for misinterpretation, which were central to the misclassifications.\n",
      "3.  **Refined Instructions for Evaluating Agent Analyses:**\n",
      "    *   Shifts focus from \"which is more useful\" to \"which description provides more crucial insights\" and \"why they found it sexist/not sexist.\"\n",
      "    *   Encourages finding value in the Skeptic's observation even if their label is ultimately disagreed with.\n",
      "4.  **More Detailed \"Analysis\" Field in JSON:** The prompt for the \"analysis\" field now has sub-points guiding the adjudicator to explicitly address the new guidelines (definition of sexism, handling of critique, detailed engagement with agent reasoning). This makes the reasoning more transparent and structured.\n",
      "5.  **Adjusted Agent Descriptions:** The parenthetical explanations for Skeptic and Optimist agents were slightly off in the original prompt (\"Skeptic Agent (leans toward detecting possible false positives)\" should be *cautious about* false negatives, and vice-versa). I've corrected this to reflect their likely behavior:\n",
      "    *   Skeptic: Flags more, so is cautious about *missing* sexism (false negatives).\n",
      "    *   Optimist: Flags less, so is cautious about *wrongly flagging* (false positives).\n",
      "    *(Self-correction: The original prompt had this right in the long form text, but the short descriptions were a bit confusing. My suggested parenthetical might still be confusing. Let's rephrase:\n",
      "    *   Skeptic Agent (tends to identify sexism, cautious about false negatives – i.e., missing actual sexism).\n",
      "    *   Optimist Agent (tends to be more lenient, cautious about false positives – i.e., incorrectly labeling something as sexist).\n",
      "    I'll use the phrasing from your original prompt which is clear in its longer form, \"Skeptic Agent (leans toward detecting possible false positives)\" is actually fine if we interpret \"possible false positives\" as \"things *it thinks* might be false positives if *not* flagged\" but it's usually meant as the agent *produces* false positives. Let's stick to the clearer \"Skeptic Agent (leans toward detecting possible false positives [by others, hence flags more, thus is cautious about *its own* false negatives])\" is too complex.\n",
      "    The original \"Skeptic Agent (leans toward detecting possible false positives)\" and \"Optimist Agent (leans toward avoiding false negatives)\" implies the Skeptic *challenges* things it thinks are FPs from an earlier stage, and Optimist *challenges* things it thinks are FNs.\n",
      "    Let's re-read your prompt: \"one highly cautious about false negatives and one cautious about false positives\".\n",
      "    - Highly cautious about false negatives = Optimist (doesn't want to miss things, so will label YES more often to avoid missing it).\n",
      "    - Cautious about false positives = Skeptic (doesn't want to wrongly accuse, so will label NO more often).\n",
      "    The example Gemini output says: \"Skeptic Agent ... 'YES' (sexist) prediction\" and \"Optimist Agent... 'NO' (not sexist) prediction\". This implies:\n",
      "    - Skeptic: Tends to predict YES (sexist). This means it's cautious about *false negatives* (missing sexism).\n",
      "    - Optimist: Tends to predict NO (not sexist). This means it's cautious about *false positives* (wrongly calling something sexist).\n",
      "    So the descriptions in *your original prompt text* are:\n",
      "    \"one highly cautious about false negatives\" -> this agent would try to *avoid* false negatives, so it would flag more readily (predict YES more often). This sounds like the Skeptic.\n",
      "    \"one cautious about false positives\" -> this agent would try to *avoid* false positives, so it would flag less readily (predict NO more often). This sounds like the Optimist.\n",
      "    I'll re-align the parenthetical descriptions based on this logic, matching common understanding:\n",
      "    Skeptic Agent: cautious about false positives (tries to avoid wrongly calling something sexist, so leans NO).\n",
      "    Optimist Agent: cautious about false negatives (tries to avoid missing actual sexism, so leans YES).\n",
      "    However, your examples show:\n",
      "    Skeptic: Prediction: YES -> often YES\n",
      "    Optimist: Prediction: NO -> often NO\n",
      "    This means:\n",
      "    Skeptic = cautious about missing sexism (false negatives), so it labels more things as YES.\n",
      "    Optimist = cautious about wrongly accusing (false positives), so it labels more things as NO.\n",
      "\n",
      "    Okay, the initial prompt text says: \"one highly cautious about false negatives and one cautious about false positives\".\n",
      "    Then it labels them:\n",
      "    \"Skeptic Agent (leans toward detecting possible false positives)\"\n",
      "    \"Optimist Agent (leans toward avoiding false negatives)\"\n",
      "\n",
      "    This is confusing. Let's clarify the *roles* based on their names and typical behavior, and align it with your descriptions.\n",
      "    - Skeptic: Likely more critical, more prone to see issues. So, more likely to label \"YES\" to sexism. This means they are *cautious about false negatives* (don't want to miss sexism).\n",
      "    - Optimist: Likely more forgiving, looks for positive interpretations. So, more likely to label \"NO\" to sexism. This means they are *cautious about false positives* (don't want to wrongly accuse something of being sexist).\n",
      "\n",
      "    Let's re-label them in the prompt to be crystal clear about their biases:\n",
      "    Skeptic Agent (prioritizes detecting sexism, cautious about *missing* instances of sexism - i.e., false negatives):\n",
      "    Optimist Agent (prioritizes avoiding over-flagging, cautious about *wrongly labeling* content as sexist - i.e., false positives):\n",
      "\n",
      "    This aligns with the common understanding of these terms and the observed behavior (Skeptic tends to say YES, Optimist tends to say NO). I'll use this in the revised prompt.\n",
      "    *(Final re-check: The original prompt says \"Skeptic Agent (leans toward detecting possible false positives)\" and \"Optimist Agent (leans toward avoiding false negatives)\". This means the Skeptic is trying to find cases where the *Optimist* might have created a false positive (by saying NO when it should be YES), and vice-versa. This is an unusual naming scheme.\n",
      "    If Skeptic leans towards detecting FPs, it means it's trying to *correct* cases that *it believes were wrongly flagged as sexist*. So it would lean NO.\n",
      "    If Optimist leans towards avoiding FNs, it means it's trying to *correct* cases that *it believes were wrongly missed*. So it would lean YES.\n",
      "    This is the OPPOSITE of the agent behavior in the examples (where Skeptic says YES, Optimist says NO).\n",
      "    Given the examples, the *behavior* is: Skeptic=YES tendency, Optimist=NO tendency.\n",
      "    So:\n",
      "    Skeptic: Cautious about false negatives (doesn't want to miss sexism, so says YES more).\n",
      "    Optimist: Cautious about false positives (doesn't want to wrongly label, so says NO more).\n",
      "    I will adjust the prompt based on this observed behavior and standard terminology.*)\n",
      "\n",
      "    I've updated the parenthetical descriptions of the agents in the revised prompt to be:\n",
      "    `Skeptic Agent (prioritizes identifying sexism, thus cautious about false negatives - i.e., missing actual sexism):`\n",
      "    `Optimist Agent (prioritizes avoiding over-classification, thus cautious about false positives - i.e., wrongly labeling content as sexist):`\n",
      "    This makes their described caution align with their likely output bias.\n",
      "6.  **Confidence Score:** The probability score is already there and useful for borderline cases.\n",

      "Gemini's description: The Optimist Agent's description provides more crucial insights. While the Skeptic Agent accurately describes the video's content (a recounting and critique of a man's sexist statement), the Optimist Agent's description better captures the *nature and framing* of that critique: 'satirically critiquing... with the video's framing clearly opposing and mocking these sexist views.' This distinction is vital because the guidelines require assessing whether a critique is clear and effective enough to prevent the video itself from being sexist, which the Optimist's description directly addresses.\n",
      "Gemini's analysis: 1. The video content (transcript) depicts sexist statements made by a man (e.g., 'he didn't like women who are beautiful and know it,' 'some women are so stuck up'). However, the entirety of the video, narrated by the woman, is a direct, explicit, and satirical critique of these statements. She refutes his views by highlighting women's autonomy ('we all have mirrors now,' 'yours are not required') and attributing his stance to insecurity ('strong women make me feel funny because i know i have nothing to offer them'). The video does not promote, normalize, perpetuate, or glorify these sexist ideas; instead, it actively deconstructs and mocks them. The depiction of the man's sexism is immediately followed by strong countervailing context.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. The video contains a clear and effective critique and satire of sexism. The satirical intent is evident in the woman's tone, direct address, and concluding laughter. It is highly unlikely to be missed or misinterpreted by a general audience as an endorsement of the man's views. The sexist elements (the man's quotes) are presented as the subject of the critique and do not overshadow the critique itself; rather, they are the catalyst for it. The method of critique, while a strong takedown of the man's attitude, focuses on his specific sexist behavior and perceived resultant insecurity, rather than relying on or reinforcing broader harmful sexist tropes against men as a gender. Her statements are a direct response to *his* sexism.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. The Optimist Agent's prediction of 'NO' and its description aligns more closely with this analysis and the provided guidelines. The Optimist correctly identifies that 'the video's framing clearly opposing and mocking these sexist views' is key. The Skeptic Agent's description is factually accurate, but its 'YES' prediction would imply that any video discussing and critiquing sexism by quoting sexist remarks is inherently sexist. This is not supported by the guidelines if the critique is clear, effective, and does not itself become problematic. The video clearly frames the man's comments as sexist and dedicates its entirety to refuting and ridiculing them. Therefore, the video itself does not *exhibit sexist content*; it exhibits a *critique* of sexism.\n",

      "Gemini's description: The Optimist Agent's description provides more crucial insights. It accurately identifies the presence of two women (though one is very brief and from a different creator's clip), the specific product feature (drawstrings to cinch the waist), the creator's satisfaction ('snatched' look), the partner's positive reaction, and crucially, the framing as a 'product review and demonstration.' This detailed framing is essential because the core question becomes whether a product review, in this context, can still exhibit sexist content by perpetuating gendered beauty standards, which the Optimist's description allows us to analyze more deeply than the Skeptic's very brief, factual statement.\n",
      "Gemini's analysis: 1. The video aligns with the definition of 'exhibits sexist content' because it promotes, normalizes, and perpetuates a specific, gendered beauty stereotype: the 'snatched' or unnaturally cinched waist for women. This ideal is historically and predominantly imposed on women, and the societal pressure to conform to such narrow beauty standards can be harmful, contributing to body image issues, self-esteem problems, and the objectification of women's bodies. The video showcases a product designed to achieve this look, and Mikayla Nogueira expresses satisfaction with the result ('I do look snatched, okay?'), thereby reinforcing the desirability of this specific body modification. The initial clip referencing a 'five inches' reduction further emphasizes the potentially extreme nature of the alteration being normalized.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. The video does not contain any critique, satire, or condemnation of the underlying beauty standard itself. Mikayla Nogueira's surprise and commentary ('$178!? just why', 'No one mentions that') are directed solely at the high price of the swimsuit. This financial critique does not extend to questioning *why* such a product exists or *why* women might feel pressure to achieve such a 'snatched' look. The framing as a product review, where the product's effectiveness in achieving the cinched waist is positively demonstrated, means the video reinforces the gendered beauty ideal rather than challenging or contextualizing it critically. The potential for misinterpretation is low regarding critique because no critique of the beauty standard is offered; instead, the standard is implicitly endorsed through the positive product demonstration.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. The Optimist Agent correctly frames the video as a 'product review and demonstration.' However, their 'NO' prediction overlooks how such a review can still perpetuate sexist norms if the product itself and its marketed effects cater to and reinforce potentially harmful gender stereotypes. The Skeptic Agent's 'YES' prediction, while based on a very brief description, aligns with the final assessment that the video does exhibit sexist content. The video doesn't just show a swimsuit; it promotes a body-altering garment that helps women conform to a narrow, historically loaded, and gender-specific aesthetic. By positively reviewing its effectiveness in achieving this 'snatched' look without any critical discussion of the beauty standard itself, the video normalizes and perpetuates the pursuit of this ideal, fitting the provided definition of exhibiting sexist content. The lack of 'sufficient countervailing context' regarding the beauty standard is key.\n",

      "**Key Considerations for Your Analysis:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Defining \"Exhibits Sexist Content\":**\n",
      "    *   A video exhibits sexist content if it promotes, normalizes, perpetuates, or glorifies harmful gender stereotypes, demeans individuals or groups based on gender, or depicts gender-based discrimination/inequality without sufficient countervailing context *within the video itself*.\n",
      "    *   **Severity of Depicted Sexism:** Content may be classified as 'exhibiting sexist content' due to the sheer presence, severity, explicitness, or extended depiction of sexist acts or speech. Even if an attempt at critique is present, consider if the *depiction itself* is sufficiently impactful (e.g., by platforming egregious statements, dwelling on harmful acts) that it could be deeply offensive, traumatic, or risk normalizing the problematic content for a general audience, regardless of the creator's ultimate intent. The ground truth often prioritizes the *impact of the sexist elements presented*.\n",
      "    *   **Harmful Gender Stereotypes:** Focus on whether the video *actively promotes adherence* to stereotypes that are *demonstrably restrictive, demeaning, or that contribute to inequality* (e.g., suggesting inherent inferiority/superiority, limiting roles, objectifying).\n",
      "        *   Differentiate this from personal expressions of style, aesthetic preference, or product reviews that might exist within broader societal norms, *unless* these are presented as rigid requirements for a gender, are coupled with demeaning commentary, overtly sexualize in a non-consensual manner, or clearly punish deviation from the norm. A video showing a person liking a beauty product is not inherently sexist unless it crosses into these more harmful territories.\n",
      "    *   **Critique, Satire, or Condemnation:** Videos that aim to critique, satirize, or condemn sexism *can still be classified as exhibiting sexist content* if:\n",
      "        *   The sexist elements being critiqued are presented in a gratuitous, excessive, highly impactful, or extended way that might overshadow or insufficiently contextualize the critique (as per \"Severity of Depicted Sexism\" above).\n",
      "        *   The critique or satirical intent is unclear, ambiguous, could be easily missed or misinterpreted by a general audience, potentially leading to the reinforcement of the sexist ideas presented rather than their deconstruction.\n",
      "        *   The method of critique itself relies on or reinforces other sexist tropes.\n",
      "    *   Simply *depicting* or *quoting* sexist behavior or speech (e.g., for news reporting, documentary, or educational purposes where the problematic nature is made explicitly clear and the focus is on analysis/information, not the gratuitous display of the sexism itself) does not automatically make the video sexist, but the *framing, balance, and impact* are crucial.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.  **Evaluating Agent Analyses:**\n",
      "    *   Do not automatically favor the agent whose conclusion aligns with your initial impression.\n",
      "    *   Critically assess *both* agents' descriptions and reasoning.\n",
      "        *   The **Skeptic Agent** might highlight problematic elements or potential negative impacts that are valid, even if you disagree with their final label. Consider *why* they found it sexist, and if their observations point to aspects that align with the \"Severity of Depicted Sexism\" or \"Harmful Gender Stereotypes\" definitions.\n",
      "        *   The **Optimist Agent** might correctly identify context, intent, or counter-narratives. However, assess if this context *effectively neutralizes* the sexism presented (especially in light of \"Severity\") or if it's a nuanced interpretation that a general viewer might miss or that doesn't negate the harm of the depiction.\n",

      "    *   Ground your decision in specific evidence from the transcript and (if available/described) the video's visual and auditory elements.\n",
      "    *   Consider: Who is speaking? What is their tone? What is the power dynamic? How are different genders portrayed? Is there a clear narrative arc that contextualizes or challenges any sexist elements? How much focus/airtime is given to the sexist content versus the critique/context?\n",

Do the sexist elements depicted nonetheless make the video sexist due to their nature, severity, presentation, or potential for misinterpretation/harm, as per the guidelines?\n",
      "    *   Compare and contrast the specific points made by the Skeptic and Optimist agents. Explain how their descriptions and reasoning align (or don't) with your final assessment and the guidelines.

      "    *   A new sub-bullet under \"Defining 'Exhibits Sexist Content'\" directly addresses the learning from the Chelsea Hart misclassification (Expected: YES, Predicted: NO).

      "    *   Crucially, it adds a differentiator for \"personal expressions of style, aesthetic preference, or product reviews\" *unless* they cross certain lines (e.g., rigid requirements, demeaning commentary). This directly addresses the bathing suit misclassification (Expected: NO, Predicted: YES), providing a path for the adjudicator to understand why that case might not be sexist according to the ground truth, without weakening the overall stance against harmful stereotypes.\n",

      "    *   **Critique, Satire, or Condemnation:** Videos that aim to critique, satirize, or condemn sexism *can still be classified as exhibiting sexist content* if:\n",
      "        *   The sexist elements being critiqued are presented in a gratuitous, excessive, highly impactful, or extended way that might overshadow or insufficiently contextualize the critique (as per \"Severity of Depicted Sexism\" above).\n",
      "        *   The critique or satirical intent is unclear, ambiguous, could be easily missed or misinterpreted by a general audience, potentially leading to the reinforcement of the sexist ideas presented rather than their deconstruction.\n",
      "        *   The method of critique itself relies on or reinforces other sexist tropes.\n",
      "    *   Simply *depicting* or *quoting* sexist behavior or speech (e.g., for news reporting, documentary, or educational purposes where the problematic nature is made explicitly clear and the focus is on analysis/information, not the gratuitous display of the sexism itself) does not automatically make the video sexist, but the *framing, balance, and impact* are crucial.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.  **Evaluating Agent Analyses:**\n",
      "    *   Do not automatically favor the agent whose conclusion aligns with your initial impression.\n",
      "    *   Critically assess *both* agents' descriptions and reasoning.\n",
      "        *   The **Skeptic Agent** might highlight problematic elements or potential negative impacts that are valid, even if you disagree with their final label. Consider *why* they found it sexist, and if their observations point to aspects that align with the \"Severity of Depicted Sexism\" or \"Harmful Gender Stereotypes\" definitions.\n",
      "        *   The **Optimist Agent** might correctly identify context, intent, or counter-narratives. However, assess if this context *effectively neutralizes* the sexism presented (especially in light of \"Severity\") or if it's a nuanced interpretation that a general viewer might miss or that doesn't negate the harm of the depiction.\n",
      "    *   Your goal is to synthesize insights. Identify which agent's *description and reasoning* (or parts thereof) more accurately captures the full context and potential impact of the video in light of the definitions above.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.  **Analyzing Video Transcript & Content:**\n",
      "    *   Ground your decision in specific evidence from the transcript and (if available/described) the video's visual and auditory elements.\n",
      "    *   Consider: Who is speaking? What is their tone? What is the power dynamic? How are different genders portrayed? Is there a clear narrative arc that contextualizes or challenges any sexist elements? How much focus/airtime is given to the sexist content versus the critique/context?\n",
      "\n",
      "4.  **Justification:** Your final decision must be well-justified. In the \"analysis\" field of the JSON, you must:\n",
      "    *   Explain *why* the video does or does not exhibit sexist content, referencing specific parts of the video and the definitions provided in Point 1.\n",
      "    *   Explicitly address how any critique, satire, or condemnation is handled: Is it clear and effective enough? Do the sexist elements depicted nonetheless make the video sexist due to their nature, severity, presentation, or potential for misinterpretation/harm, as per the guidelines?\n",
      "    *   Compare and contrast the specific points made by the Skeptic and Optimist agents. Explain how their descriptions and reasoning align (or don't) with your final assessment and the guidelines. It's not just about whose label you agree with, but whose *analysis* (or components of it) best supports a decision based on these guidelines.\n",

      "**Key Refinements in this Version and Why:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Stronger Emphasis on \"Severity of Depicted Sexism\":**\n",
      "    *   A new sub-bullet under \"Defining 'Exhibits Sexist Content'\" directly addresses the learning from the Chelsea Hart misclassification (Expected: YES, Predicted: NO). It states that even critiqued content can be sexist if the *depiction itself* is severe or impactful enough, aligning with the insight that \"ground truth might be more focused on the *presence and potential impact* of the sexist elements themselves.\"\n",
      "    *   This is also reinforced in the \"Critique, Satire, or Condemnation\" section.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.  **Nuanced Guidance on \"Harmful Gender Stereotypes\":**\n",
      "    *   The definition is refined to focus on stereotypes that are \"demonstrably restrictive, demeaning, or that contribute to inequality.\"\n",
      "    *   Crucially, it adds a differentiator for \"personal expressions of style, aesthetic preference, or product reviews\" *unless* they cross certain lines (e.g., rigid requirements, demeaning commentary). This directly addresses the bathing suit misclassification (Expected: NO, Predicted: YES), providing a path for the adjudicator to understand why that case might not be sexist according to the ground truth, without weakening the overall stance against harmful stereotypes.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.  **Reinforced Agent Evaluation:**\n",
      "    *   Minor tweaks to encourage looking for how agent observations might align with the newly emphasized \"Severity\" or refined \"Stereotypes\" definitions.\n",
      "    *   The goal is synthesis and finding value in *why* an agent made their assessment.\n",
      "\n",
      "4.  **Explicit Guidance in \"Justification\" and JSON \"analysis\":**\n",
      "    *   The instructions for the \"analysis\" field are more explicitly tied back to the key definitions (Severity, Stereotypes, Critique handling) to ensure these new nuances are directly addressed in the adjudicator's reasoning.\n",
      "    *   The JSON structure for `analysis` now prompts for these specific points, making the expected reasoning clearer.\n",
      "\n",
      "5.  **Clarity on Agent Roles:** Maintained the clearer descriptions of Skeptic and Optimist agent biases from your revised prompt.\n",
      "\n",
      "6.  **JSON Format Consistency:** Ensured the final JSON output structure in the prompt matches the detailed `analysis` description as it was in your provided \"Revised Prompt\", which is more robust for capturing detailed reasoning. The `probability` is a string in your example output (\"0.95\") but a number in the prompt description. I've kept it as \"A number...\" in the description text but acknowledge in practice it might be output as a string in JSON by some systems. The template shows it as a number, which is generally preferred for numerical values. I'll ensure the template in my response makes `probability` a number, not a string. *Self-correction: My template already makes probability a number without quotes. Good.*\n",
      "\n",
      "These changes aim to equip the adjudicator with a more precise framework to handle the specific types of subtle cases that led to misclassifications, particularly by giving more weight to the impact of depicted sexism and providing a clearer threshold for what constitutes the promotion of \"harmful\" stereotypes in contexts like product reviews.\n"
