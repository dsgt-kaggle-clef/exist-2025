cc  buckle up, everyone. we all know what feminism is, right? fighting for the equality of the sexes. but did you know about womanism? in the 1960s and 1970s, feminism took over, but it was mostly focused on white women and ignored women of color.

that's when author and activist alice walker, known for ""the color purple,"" coined the term womanism. a womanist is a feminist who fights for equality of the sexes, regardless of race, sexual orientation, or class.

but because this movement was focused on people of color, we never learned about it. instead, we learned about figures like susan b. anthony, who didn't support black people.

you know who did support black people? black women. so yeah, there's that.  all right episode one of things we should have learned in school but didn't buckle up okay so like we all know what feminism is right like fighting for equality of the sexes we all know that but we never learned what womanism is so in the 1960s and 70s feminism took over right like it was a whole huge movement fighting for the equality of sex. the problem was this movement was taken over by white women and proceeded to ignore women of color, right? so that's when author and activist alice walker, you know, the color purple, that's her, coined the term womanism. so like a womanist is basically a feminist who is fighting for the equality of sexes, but more specifically equality of sexes throughout no matter your race, sexual orientation, or class. but because the movement was focused on people of color, we didn't learn about it. you know what we did learn about? susan b. anthony. and guess what? she didn't like black people. you know who's a black people? black women! so yeah, there's that.",videos/6904648422859558149.mp4,1,ERROR,ERROR,ERROR
