220148,"psychology homeworks got me up way too late search in humans has demonstrated no consistent tendency for people to prefer pleasant odors of the opposite sex. recent research has provided a link between sexual orientation and responses to odors. researchers used positron emission tomography (pet) scans to study the brain's response to two odors  one related to testosterone, which is produced in men's sweat, and the other related to estrogen, which is found in women's urine. the testosterone-based odor activated the hypothalamus, a part of the brain that controls sexual behavior, in heterosexual women but not in heterosexual men. the estrogen-based odor activated the hypothalamus in heterosexual men but not in homosexual men. strikingly, homosexual men responded to the two chemicals in the same way as heterosexual women did. common odors unrelated to sexual arousal were processed similarly by all three groups. taken together, these studies suggest that some human pheromones related to sexual orientation are processed similarly by heterosexual, homosexual, and bisexual individuals.  so i'm reading through my psychology homework and i've stumbled across a crazy realization. they did a study in 2005 where they exposed, i'm assuming, self-proclaimed heterosexuals, men and women, to the opposing sex's pheromones. so women were exposed to testosterone and men were exposed to estrogen. now when the women were exposed to testosterone. this tiny little part of their brain called the hypothalamus flickered. and same with the men when they were exposed to estrogen. now here's where it gets really interesting. when they did the same thing on homosexual men, their hypothalamus lit up just like the heterosexual women. but when heterosexual men were exposed to testosterone, it didn't light up. i might be jumping to conclusions, but does this mean that we can test your sexual orientation with science?",videos/6884830096608283909.mp4,0,"A young man discusses a psychology study from his homework, detailing how the hypothalamus in heterosexual women, heterosexual men, and homosexual men responds differently to pheromones, and questions if this means sexual orientation can be scientifically tested.",NO,"The video describes a scientific study on brain responses to pheromones across different sexual orientations and sexes without promoting gender stereotypes, male superiority, misogyny, or marginalizing women; it is an informational sharing of a psychology finding, not an embodiment or criticism of sexism."
