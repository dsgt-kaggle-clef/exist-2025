While the content is adult in nature, it does not inherently criticize, marginalize, or show prejudice against women based on gender stereotypes, nor does it express beliefs in male superiority or misogynistic views."
220266,"responder a the majority of male murderers are other men.  la mayoría de lo que asesinan hombres son otros hombres. yo sabía que más de alguna siera tirada ese comentario porque son tan predecibles las feministas. y se auto-humillan solas porque al tan solo decir que a los hombres los matan otros hombres eso quiere decir que a las mujeres no las están matando solo por ser mujer y si son más hombres asesinados que mujeres entonces ustedes no son la gran víctima y los que están siendo invisibilizados son los hombres y no las mujeres. esto es un show que lo convierten en guerras de género porque el que mata no es un hombre es un asesino, el que viola no es un hombre sino que es un violador. y para finalizar voy a dar una estadística argentina, ya que es un país mucho más grande que el mío. en la custodia de los niños, las mujeres tienen un 82,2% de ganarla. y en abusadores de niños, las mujeres superan a los hombres con sigue mi instagram para más videos sin censura.",videos/6927014177554959621.mp4,1,"A man in a red and black plaid shirt responds to a comment stating that most men who are murdered are killed by other men, by arguing that this proves women are not killed simply for being women, that feminists are predictable and self-humiliating, and that men are the true invisibilized victims, citing Argentinian statistics on child custody and abuse.",YES,"The video exhibits sexism by generalizing and belittling feminists (e.g., 'predictable', 'self-humiliate'), downplaying gender-based violence against women by misrepresenting arguments about femicide and using 'whataboutism' to shift focus to male victims, and presenting statistics in a way that suggests women are inherently more abusive or unfairly favored, thereby promoting prejudice against women and undermining the concept of systemic gender inequality."

This type of gender-based commentary frequently targets actions perceived as problematic within gender dynamics, thus either criticizing manifestations of sexism or embodying sexism through generalization."

By using the ""shock"" of encountering such content as a punchline without any critique, the video implicitly normalizes or trivializes exposure to material that often embodies sexism, thus indirectly reflecting a casual acceptance of it."

This contributes to the objectification and comparative evaluation of women based on vague, likely superficial, standards."
220812," when washing your car, a man walking by says, ""you couldn't be my wife. women don't wash cars.""  that'll do it. you don't have to worry about me. you do not have to worry about me.",videos/7090993471183539498.mp4,1,"A woman lip-syncs a sarcastic response to a man who told her she couldn't be his wife because she was washing her car, a task he believes women don't do.",YES,"The video directly criticizes sexism by showcasing a real-life instance of a gender stereotype being enforced, where a man suggests a woman's activity (washing a car) makes her unsuitable as a wife because 'women don't wash cars.' The woman's sarcastic reaction in the video serves to mock and highlight the absurdity of this sexist belief."

This can be interpreted as normalizing or encouraging aggression against women during intimacy, which aligns with harmful gender stereotypes about male dominance and aggression in sexual encounters."

This points to a subtle form of gender-based imposition and the discomfort women frequently experience and must navigate."
