The focus on their gender makes the judgment appear tied to their identity as young women, rather than solely being a critique of vaping in general."

While a man plays female characters in wigs, which can be a caricature, the humor primarily targets the stereotype about men and the general awkwardness or crudeness of the answers in a game show parody, rather than embodying prejudice against women based on specific gender stereotypes."

While it involves a male character initiating a sudden kiss, a common trope in romantic fiction, it's framed within a fantasy context requested by a fan and doesn't overtly marginalize women, promote harmful gender stereotypes as prescriptive, or espouse male superiority or misogyny; it's a piece of lighthearted genre entertainment."

220611,"been gone for a week but im back now cat_with_wry_smile  text  is there no alternative? books by mark fisher about capitalist realism and its impact on society are available on amazon. capitalist realism has become the dominant ideology, making it difficult to imagine alternatives to capitalism. it is reinforced through media that presents anti-capitalist ideas without challenging the system. when emily, a 13-year-old gemini who supports black lives matter and advocates for defunding the police, comments ""this isn't funny my guy"" on a post, it sparks a discussion about the perpetuation of capitalist ideals in media and society. the media often glorifies historical accuracy, even if it means portraying scenes of violence against women. this can trigger misogynistic individuals, who feel their beliefs are being challenged. it's important to recognize and challenge the dominant ideology of capitalist realism.  you know something i found very interesting? it's how all oppressive structures, most notably when they reach their late stage, all adopt a certain feature that allows them to maintain their oppressive power. the tactic is admittedly very clever. what is it you may ask? let me tell you. if you haven't already read it, mark fisher makes a point in this book about how this happens in late-stage capitalism. i'm sure y'all have seen this image of asc's dress with a mark fisher quote on it, talking about how anti-capitalist themes are being consumed by the media without actually challenging the system. anti-capitalism has become something that you cosplay as instead of something that you actively fight towards. what mark fisher says doesn't only apply to capitalism. i'm here to tell you right now that it applies to every oppressive structure, including late-stage racism and late-stage misogyny. things like the blue-haired emily mee made it so that things like blm and acab look more like aesthetics than they do actual movements. and then watch how anti-sexism becomes a trend, an aesthetic, something you perform. notice how the people at the forefront of these progressive aesthetics are not the people marginalized by the oppressive structure but they're the oppressors themselves this tactic is so effective because it delegitimizes the seriousness of these movements which just makes it seem corny to support them we need to support",videos/7017889713491152133.mp4,0,"A young man discusses how oppressive structures, including late-stage capitalism, racism, and misogyny, co-opt counter-movements by turning them into mere aesthetics or trends, thus diluting their power.",YES,The video explicitly names 'late-stage misogyny' as an oppressive structure and criticizes how anti-sexism can be co-opted and turned into a performative aesthetic rather than a genuine fight against the system.
