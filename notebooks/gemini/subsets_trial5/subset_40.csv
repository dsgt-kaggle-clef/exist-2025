her lips didn't move for a reason. innocence was proven innocent, but force was used to make her guilty. we all know the truth, but we still ask, ""why were you sick?"" we all know the answer. self defense is a last resort. we all know a woman is not safe alone at night. we all know she should have been more cautious and wary. she deserved better. we all feel guilty and know this is not about us. we need to listen and understand.  was she asking for it if her lips didn't move? is her innocence really what we need to prove? it isn't her guilt, but you'll force her to own it. cos we all know that no can mean yes if you moan it. and if you're sick of hearing it, we're sick of saying it, self-defence lectures and fruitlessly praying it won't be the last time we walk home alone or wait up for texts that our girls are safe home. we all know a woman both cautious and wary who went into the world despite it being scary and she deserved better. we all fucking do. and i know that you feel this is not about you, but if you are a man, you're complicit in violence that feasts on your apathy, nourished by silence. so listen, or don't. i won't dictate your choice, but it's speak up or shut up. an ear or a voice. look through your people and recheck your friends list, because we all know a victim. but don't know the rapist.",videos/7112743972669295878.mp4,1,ERROR,ERROR,ERROR
