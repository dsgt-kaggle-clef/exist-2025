The overlaid comment, which doubts the veracity of such allegations and suggests female accusers are vengeful, embodies a common sexist trope used to discredit victims; its inclusion serves to critique this dismissive and harmful societal reaction to women's testimonies."

This reflects prejudice based on gender stereotypes and promotes the idea that women's behavior should be policed to avoid male discomfort."

220816,"reply to   same goes with how reclaiming queer ancestral relationalities doesn’t mean people can’t be straight reply to zyloxxoo's comment ""white centered things"" lol how is saying monogamy doesn't automatically ipso facto mean colonialism white? i'm not white or cis het. the tenets of whiteness include binary and linear expression and thought, obsession with perfection, denial or dismissal of individuality, and an obsession with hierarchy and niceness over kindness. this is reflected in the inflation of productivity and the work of white individuals, while ignoring the work and contributions of bipoc community advocates. i refuse to cite non-melanated sources and instead choose to support and uplift the voices of bipoc individuals. join us next month on patreon as we dive deep into studying whiteness and actively work towards divesting from it.  so i don't know who needs to hear this, but like you can be perpetuating tenets of whiteness without being white yourself. so i'd say these comments are an example of binary thinking and linear expression of thought, which is a tenet of whiteness. you can follow this instagram page to learn more about that. so i never said anything equals anything. i'm simply calling out the logic of the binary thinking in your original comment. and so i think your original comment was white-centered because it didn't seem to be centering the people who are most marginalized within the polyamorous community who are trying to do the work to reclaim ancestral forms of relationalities that have been lost in our communities. so the alternative to binary thinking is starting to accept that multiple things can be true at once. so in this case, i can talk about the importance of reclaiming ancestral relationalities without saying that everybody needs to be doing that. i never said everyone needs to be doing that.",videos/7091873201776512298.mp4,0,"A person responds to a comment, explaining that one can perpetuate 'tenets of whiteness' such as binary thinking without being white, and relates this to a discussion about monogamy and colonialism.",NO,"The video's content focuses on concepts of 'whiteness,' colonialism, and binary thinking in relation to relationship structures like monogamy and polyamory. It does not engage with or criticize sexism, gender stereotypes, male superiority, or misogyny."
220043," manspreading in the daily mail.  the advent of manspreading, what an extraordinary thing. it was actually the invention of this word that inspired me to stop calling myself a feminist, because i realised the ideology that i thought meant freedom and equality was actually just a load of rubbish that had been hijacked by idiots who make up words to prove their point. and look, to explain what manspreading is, it was explained to me originally as the theory that men sit with their legs far apart on public transport to sort of invade women's space and sort of stake their claim as part of the furniture, so to speak, and that it was a terribly sexist thing and designed to infringe on women's space. and now we know that's not the case. and i'm going to phrase this very delicately, peter, for this prime time slot. anyone with a basic knowledge of the human anatomy will know why gentlemen tend to sit with their legs slightly further apart than women do. it's...",videos/6821436083004263686.mp4,1,"A woman on a news segment explains that the term 'manspreading' (men sitting with legs wide apart) led her to stop identifying as a feminist, arguing that the behavior is due to male anatomy, not a sexist act to encroach on women's space.",YES,"The video criticizes the concept of 'manspreading' as a valid example of sexism. The speaker argues that the term and its underlying accusation of sexist intent by men are unfounded, based on a misunderstanding of male anatomy, and represent a flawed aspect of feminist ideology."

Advice like 'grab her and don't let go' when she pushes or hits dangerously blurs the lines of consent and normalizes disregarding a woman's expressed actions or boundaries."

The woman's explicit rejection of his advances and her assertion of her own financial independence serve as a critique of this stereotypical and arguably sexist approach.

This behavior creates an uncomfortable power dynamic, disregards her boundaries, and leverages his male parental role to introduce inappropriate sexual content, which can be seen as a form of gendered imposition."

The caption is presented sarcastically to highlight the absurdity of the stereotype.

This critique addresses a form of sexism within feminist discourse by pointing out how centering only one group's experience of womanhood can perpetuate inequality among women."

One specific line attributed to 'Omnisexual' features a male voice yelling 'stfu sally' at a character with a female name. This act of a male character aggressively silencing a female character, even in a comedic and chaotic game context, can be interpreted as embodying a misogynistic dynamic of dismissing or demeaning women's participation or voice."
