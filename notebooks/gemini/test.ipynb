    "#     You are an expert in identifying sexism in video content. Your primary task is to distinguish between videos that *are themselves sexist* (i.e., they actively promote, endorse, or normalize sexism through their own message, framing, or overall presentation) and videos that merely *depict, discuss, or incidentally include* sexist content (e.g., for critique, satire, factual reporting, artistic expression, or as part of a narrative where the video *itself* does not endorse the sexism). Focus on what the *video creator* is trying to convey as their own viewpoint or message, not just what is shown or said within the video.\n",

    "#     *   **Marginalization:** The video *itself* presents a gender (typically women) as inherently less important, capable, or deserving, or unfairly limits their opportunities or voice *due to their gender*, in a manner the video appears to support or normalize.\n",
    "#     *   **Harmful Stereotypes:** The video *itself* actively promotes demeaning, limiting, or broadly negative generalizations about a gender *as if they are inherent truths*. For this to be sexist, the video's discernible primary intent in promoting such stereotypes must be to reinforce inequality, belittle the gender, or restrict their opportunities. Observations or humor based on gender are *not* sexist under this rule *unless the video's overall framing and primary intent clearly weaponize these stereotypes to achieve such harmful outcomes as its central message.* (e.g., simply listing stereotypical \"wants\" of women is not sexist unless the video uses this to argue for their inferiority or to justify discriminatory treatment).\n",
    "#     *   **Male Superiority:** The video *itself* asserts or implies men's inherent dominance, greater value, or rightful control over women, framing this as natural, desirable, or justified.\n",
    "#     *   **Misogyny:** The video *itself*, through its own primary message or creative choices, expresses or encourages hatred, contempt, or ingrained prejudice against women. The mere inclusion of misogynistic language (e.g., in song lyrics, character dialogue) does *not* automatically make the video misogynistic *unless the video's own framing and primary intent clearly center on endorsing, celebrating, or amplifying that misogynistic sentiment as its own message.*\n",

The video itself is the source of sexist advocacy or validation.\n",
    "#     *   **Label \"NO\"**:\n",
    "#         *   If the video depicts sexist acts, language, or ideas *primarily to critique, condemn, satirize, or factually report on them*, where the video's own stance is clearly against the depicted sexism or unendorsing of it.\n",
    "#         *   If sexist ideas/actions are expressed by characters or are part of a narrative, but the *video itself does not demonstrably endorse or promote these as valid, acceptable, or desirable as part of its own primary message*. The video might be exploring complex themes or showing flawed characters without its own voice condoning the sexism.\n",
    "#         *   If the video depicts common or lighthearted gender stereotypes without the video's *own discernible primary intent* being to use these stereotypes to demean, restrict, or advocate for unequal treatment of a gender. The video isn't *weaponizing* the stereotype to push a harmful sexist agenda.\n",
    "#         *   If the video incorporates material containing sexist language or ideas (e.g., song lyrics, dialogue from a film) but the *video's own primary focus, message, and creative intent* are not to endorse or amplify the sexism within that material.
