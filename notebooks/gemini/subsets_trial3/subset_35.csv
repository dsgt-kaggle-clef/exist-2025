220439,"tips for females on site  brick  hi, can you give more tips for female bricklayers? i'm going to college for a bricklaying course and would love some tips. watch out for wall ties and make sure to clean the area thoroughly. also, use a unique exfoliating lotion and a gentle face wash. i don't like using too many products, so i recommend using a basic routine. thanks!  here's a few tips for female bricklaying and self-care on site. first of all you can have nice hands and nice nails when you're bricklaying. just buy an absolute ton of gloves and wear a new pair of gloves every day because the cement will get stuck in the gloves and it makes your hands dry so always put a new pair on and then at the end of the week i wash them all and reuse them and that also saves money. tip number two, i have a smaller trowel than the boys. this is because my elbows and wrists hurt quite often from the heavy loading on the trowel. so i have a smaller trow trowel load up a bit lighter and it just helps me a lot your strength will come in time you are going to ache in the beginning but it does get easier as you get stronger. pretty much every single time i bend over i manage to get my hair stuck on a wall tie so watch out for that. you need to keep your essentials in the back of your car, spare clothes, toilet rolls, anything. if you don't want to get spots, you need to cleanse your face at least three times a day because the dust and dirt that comes off is horrible. take a crate everywhere you go because you're definitely going to need a hop up before the boys if you're short like me. and most importantly, have fun. and don't take any shit. take any",videos/6968879158080441605.mp4,0,ERROR,ERROR,ERROR,ERROR
