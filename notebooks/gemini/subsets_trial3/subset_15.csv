220719," ""crabs in a bucket"" is nonsense.  so i'm korean, which means i like metaphors. but by far my least favorite metaphor is the whole crabs in a bucket metaphor. you know, the whole idea that crabs in a bucket are each other's own worst enemies. they're always pulling each other down instead of working together to climb out of the bucket. you know, they're dragging each other down so nobody escapes. and it's often used to shame black communities, right? for not pulling themselves together and working together to bring themselves out of the horrible situation that they might be in. the primary flaw with this analogy that is 100% relevant to the way it's applied, especially to black communities, is that it's applied especially to black communities is we never seem to ask who the fuck put the crabs in the bucket in the first place place",videos/7058005271284845871.mp4,0,"The video features a man critiquing the ""crabs in a bucket"" metaphor, particularly how it's used to blame Black communities for their circumstances, arguing that the metaphor itself is flawed because it ignores who put the crabs in the bucket; the video's own stance is critical of victim-blaming and does not promote sexism.",NO,"The video's content critiques a social metaphor and its application, focusing on systemic issues and victim-blaming, and does not promote, endorse, or normalize sexism, misogyny, or harmful gender stereotypes as its own message.",0.0
