Observations or humor based on gender are *not* sexist under this rule *unless the video's overall framing and primary intent clearly weaponize these stereotypes to achieve such harmful outcomes as its central message.* (e.g., simply listing stereotypical \"wants\" of women is not sexist unless the video uses this to argue for their inferiority or to justify discriminatory treatment).\n",
    "#     *   **Male Superiority:** The video *itself* asserts or implies men's inherent dominance, greater value, or rightful control over women, framing this as natural, desirable, or justified.\n",
    "#     *   **Misogyny:** The video *itself*, through its own primary message or creative choices, expresses or encourages hatred, contempt, or ingrained prejudice against women. The mere inclusion of misogynistic language (e.g., in song lyrics, character dialogue) does *not* automatically make the video misogynistic *unless the video's own framing and primary intent clearly center on endorsing, celebrating, or amplifying that misogynistic sentiment as its own message.*\n",
