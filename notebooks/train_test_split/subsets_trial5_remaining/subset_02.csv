This reduces a female character to a sexual connotation before she is even introduced and normalizes the sexualization of women, particularly within a familial context, which is a form of prejudice based on gender."

While the resulting word is a curse word, its usage in this context is for comedic effect stemming from the wordplay rather than an attack on women or an expression of male superiority. The mother's reaction is playful, indicating it's a family joke."
