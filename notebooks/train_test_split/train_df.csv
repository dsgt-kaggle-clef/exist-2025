one person in the discussion expressed their disapproval of roe v. wade, stating that they didn't approve of it then and still don't approve of it now. another person asked if protecting life is important to them, to which the first person replied that they believe in protecting life and enacting laws to do so.

the discussion then turned to the topic of biblical principles and whether there should be more of them enacted in laws. one person pointed out a verse in leviticus that prohibits men from spilling their seed, and another person asked if men should be forced to get vasectomies before marriage. when someone asked why not, the response was that it's a matter of controlling what men do with their bodies.

the discussion ended with someone mentioning that there should be more control, and the conversation ended with the acknowledgement that the issue of roe v. wade is a complex and divisive one.  v. wade overturned. what were your thoughts on that? i'm old enough to remember when they first did roe versus wade. i didn't approve of it then. i don't approve of it now. protecting life is important to you. the bible is important to you. do you think there should be more religious yes. in leviticus, in the bible, it says for males not to spill their seed, not to ejaculate. do you think that men should be forced to get vasectomies before they're married? no. no? no. why not? why not? married no no why not why not it just you're talking about the government forcing people to do things against their choice right right. controlling what men do with their bodies. more control.",7115081394304404779.mp4,videos/7115081394304404779.mp4,https://www.tiktok.com/@thegoodliars/video/7115081394304404779,"['Annotator_2', 'Annotator_6', 'Annotator_10']",3,"['F', 'F', 'F']","['YES', 'YES', 'YES']","['JUDGEMENTAL', 'DIRECT', 'DIRECT']","[['IDEOLOGICAL-INEQUALITY'], ['IDEOLOGICAL-INEQUALITY', 'STEREOTYPING-DOMINANCE'], ['STEREOTYPING-DOMINANCE']]",TRAIN-VIDEO_EN,1
