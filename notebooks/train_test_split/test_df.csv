Beauty pageants are often criticized for embodying sexism by objectifying women, promoting narrow beauty standards, and reinforcing gender stereotypes that primarily value women for their physical appearance. By showcasing this without critique, the video can be seen as embodying these aspects.","The video shows a woman identified by her sash as ""'19 MISS INTERNATIONAL"" in an elegant dress, smiling and interacting with people at an event; the video's framing is positive and celebratory of her presence.",NO,"The video depicts a woman, likely a beauty pageant winner, at an event without actively promoting, endorsing, or normalizing any sexist ideas, marginalization, harmful stereotypes, male superiority, or misogyny through its own message or presentation."

""Him"" tells ""Me"" to ""Watch. Your. Mouth,"" and after a retort from ""Me,"" an ominous ""Uh-oh indeed"" is stated by ""Him."" The accompanying song lyrics include ""If you dance with the devil then you're bound to get burned,"" which, in context, frames the male-coded character's dominance as a powerful force and the female-coded character's defiance as a dangerous act with inevitable negative consequences, thereby normalizing this power dynamic.",YES,"The video normalizes male dominance and control over (implicitly) female speech by presenting a scenario where a male-coded character silences and threatens a female-coded character. The video's framing, including the ominous dialogue and suggestive song lyrics, presents this dynamic without critique, thereby endorsing it as an expected or even compelling interaction where challenging male authority leads to retribution. This aligns with normalizing male superiority and control."
